## 🔧 Highlight Project

### ✈️ Multi-Modal Pathfinding Algorithm
Developed a pathfinding tool to determine optimal routes between major cities, factoring in:
- Flight stopovers
- Travel distance
- Mixed transport modes (air, rail, etc.)

The algorithm dynamically calculates shortest paths using real-world constraints to simulate efficient travel planning.
